# 🕹️ Othello Recommender

This is a full-stack web application that recommends the optimal move for each player in the game of Othello. Given an image of a real-world Othello board, the app uses computer vision to detect the board state, analyze the best moves using a minimax algorithm, and display results visually.

- Automatically detects the board layout and piece positions
- Computes the best move for both Black and White using Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning
- Displays board state and suggested moves with overlays
- Tracks and allows replay of previous submissions
